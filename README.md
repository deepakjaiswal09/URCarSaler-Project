## Why URCarSaler?

Buying or selling a car can often be a time-consuming and complex process involving multiple visits, phone calls, and negotiations. Traditional online listings may lack immediate interaction between buyers and sellers, causing delays and missed opportunities.

URCarSaler addresses these issues by providing:

- **Instant Real-Time Communication:** Using **Stream Chat**, buyers and sellers can chat instantly, ask questions, share details, and negotiate in real time.
- **Secure and Simple Authentication:** Powered by **Clerk**, users can quickly sign up or log in with modern, secure authentication flows.
- **Custom Frontend:** Unlike many projects that use standard UI kits, URCarSalerâ€™s frontend is uniquely crafted to deliver a clean, intuitive, and engaging user experience.

This combination helps reduce transaction time, improve trust, and make car trading more accessible.
